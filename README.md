# Image-Processing-Tasks

## Task 1

### Interpolation

Loads the image 'Zebra.jpg' and converts it to greyscale. Then resizes the image from its original size of 556×612 to an enlarged size of
1668×1836 by interpolation.
Implements both nearest neighbour and bilinear interpolation.


## Task 2

### Neighbourhood Processing 
Loads the image ‘Noisy.png' and convert it to greyscale. Then implements smoothing filters using averaging and median filters with
a kernel (mask) size of 5 (neighbourhood of 5×5). Using zero padding to deal with pixels on the edges of the image.


## Task 3

### Object Recognition 

Loads the image ‘Starfish.jpg’ and through a series of image processing techniques generates a binary image where zero means no starfish detected and a non zero value means that the pixel belongs to a starfish.

## Task 4

### Shape Description

Interprets the shape of a given binary object. This script produces a ‘shape signature’ for a star fish.
